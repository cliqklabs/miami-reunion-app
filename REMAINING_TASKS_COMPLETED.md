### 📊 **4. Performance Optimizations Identified** 🟡
**Current bundle analysis:**
- Main bundle: 401KB (79KB gzipped)
- Firebase service: 995KB (270KB gzipped) ⚠️
- Total assets: ~1.4MB

**Recommended optimizations** (optional for now):
```typescript
// Dynamic imports for large services
const { ImageGenerationService } = await import('./services/ImageGenerationService');
const { PrintfulCommerceService } = await import('./services/PrintfulCommerceService');

// Code splitting by route
const AdminApp = lazy(() => import('./AdminApp'));
const HouGallery = lazy(() => import('./components/HouGallery'));
```
